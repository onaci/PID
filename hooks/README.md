# DPN Ontology Hooks

The files in this directory are custom build phase hooks for the automated dockerhub builder,
and are used to configure custom behaviour for an automatic build of the DPN Ontology Server.

See https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/advanced/#custom-build-phase-hooks for more information about how they work.
